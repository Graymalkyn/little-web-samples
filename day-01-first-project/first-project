      <h2>The Iron Yard - Front End Engineering course</h2>

      <p>The course that is offered through the Dallas campus teaches and number of different things, but focuses on:

        <ul>
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
        </ul>

      <p>I am taking this training to expand my horizons.  I have done a number of things in the past, but none of them were particularly interesting to me at this time, so I'm working to <strong>reinvent</strong> myself.  Some of my concerns about choosing this course are:

        <ol>
          <li>My Age: Can this old dog learn some new tricks?</li>
          <li>Will I find employment that will allow me to pay off the cost of the class?</li>
          <li>How will the 12 weeks away from my house affect my wife and dogs?</li>
        </ol>

      <p>But then, do we ever really know what the future holds?
